Extended SIR models for modeling the outcome of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions. This is a first working version based on recently published model study by Abu-Raddad et al (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436522000214#!) Please see Appendix A (supplementary material) of this study for details about the used equations.

The code can be run on Windows, MacOS, Linux (also Raspberry) and Android using the array programming language J available as a free download from www.jsoftware.com.
